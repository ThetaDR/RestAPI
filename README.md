## Final report
### Time tracking

- Vanessa: 120 hours
- Adam: 90 hours 
- Tabea: 97 hours

### Parts of the projects, that were easy
- The routes, were you had early an idea how to do it, were good
- Some of the REST Routes

### Parts that were hard
- Connect new bits to the existing code, because I was unsure about the communication between the parts
- Use external services and make them known to each other (like Redis or Graylog)
- Manage to set a limit for upVote and downVote selected images for every user to 1.
- More complex project than most students projects before: Problems for the interaction of the different services, different kind service that we had not worked with before. But closer to real work projects than anything else.
- automated tests: Postman seems not to be good tool for more complex testing scenarios. In future we would choose in-code testing frameworks instead.
- how to setup runners and pipelines in gitlab, it got easier 

### Greatest learning experience
- Use a simple framework and add just the parts you needed, was a cool experience
- We learned a lot of small things and understand the concept of service oriented applications better
- Working with the team on the new technology.
- Using a more complex system of services, interesting new technologies and concepts
